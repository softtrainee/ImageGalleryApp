Battlebucks :Take Home Exercise

Image Gallery App
Instructions
Your task is to create a mobile app for iOS, that will let the user browse through an Image Gallery that fetches and shows images to the user in a grid layout. You can use this Free Service for fetching the images’ data.

You can use Any library to interact with the network, but yeah please write an inhouse solution to load the images and store them in Cache; please don’t use any 3rd Party solution for that.

For Image Management we need a solution that can show Image Grid without hampering the UX and has cache support to reduce network utilization for duplicate images.

Make a git repository for the project and send this to us once you are done. Write code incrementally, make multiple commits, just like you would in a real project.

Once done, you can host the solution as a public repository on any Git service (GitHub,
Bitbucket, or Gitlab are all good options) and send us the link. We will evaluate the
main branch unless otherwise specified.



Screens

Images Grid Screen

This is the home screen. When it launches, show a scrollable grid of pictures starting
with the latest images first. When the user taps on an image that should open the image detail screen.
Image Detail Screen

This screen displays the full size image along with the metadata like title, description, etc. The user should also be able to swipe to previous or next images from this screen itself; rest is up to you, whatever feature you want to add for enhancing the UX.





Evaluation
We score the exercise on three criteria, which have been selected to take a look at general programming ability rather than familiarity with specific tools or libraries.

Every submitted exercise will be graded based on the rubric and will be given a score (from 0 to 6 points). We have a certain cut-off score, which an exercise will have to meet to decide if a candidate should be taken forward to the next stage.
